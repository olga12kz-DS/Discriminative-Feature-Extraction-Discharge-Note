Urine osms were high and Na \\nwas inappropriately elevated (>40), consistent with SIADH as an \\nunderlying etiology.

If the patient's hyponatremia \\npersists/worsens with symptoms, the patient could potentially \\nbenefit from sodium tablet supplementation.  At this time, we \\nhave only encouraged the patient to eat a high salt diet.  The \\npatient should also be fluid restricted, although it seems that \\nthe patient's PO fluid intake does not exceed this restriction \\nat baseline.\\n \\nMedications on Admission:\\nAlbuterol Sulfate 90 mcg HFA ___ puffs Q4-6 hours prn  \\nAzelastine [Optivar] 0.05 % Drops 1 drop ocular ___ prn \\nallergy symptoms bothering eyes - only takes occasionally  \\nAzithromycin 250 mg 3 times a week, MWF, recently stopped  \\nDiltiazem HCl 180 mg Capsule, Sust.

Had had a previous admission one month ago for hyperkalemia in the context of lethargy and fatigue which was corrected with fluids and kayelaxate. Since her last admission, she had her stent removed and her PCN removed after an antegrade nephrostogram showed no obstruction. At baseline, pt states that she is drinking at least three large glasses of fluid each day, and eating okay for breakfast and dinner.  Pain had been well-controlled until one week ago when she developed increased pain in lower extremities, neck, sides. This is preventing her from walking much as her legs hurt after taking a few steps. Denies recent fevers, chills, nausea. No urinary symptoms including dysuria, hematuria, frequency.

She was admitted to   for the same symptoms recently and had 3L fluid removed (no SBP) three days ago and felt better. Since discharge, her abdomen has become increasingly distended with pain. This feels similar to prior episodes of ascites. Her diuretics were recently decreased on   due to worsening hyponatremia 128 and hyperkalemia 5.1. Patient states she has been compliant with her HIV and diuretic medications but never filled out the lactulose prescription. She states she has had   BMs daily at home.

Unfortunately he continued to have refractory pancytopenia and is transfusion dependent. He is undergoing HSCT evaluation and in clinic today, a routine baseline CXR revealed 'diffuse nodularity in the bilateral apices and left lower lobe,' which prompted a CT scan of the chest. Those images and report were reviewed and show 'Multifocal newly appeared consolidations in the lung parenchyma, with air bronchograms, as well as accompanying ground-glass opacities and interstitial thickening.' At present he denies respiratory symptoms but has been fatigued and reported about a month of post nasal drip and receipt of antibiotics about a month ago for possible sinusitis. On arrival to  , pt does admit to sinus infection and pressure/PND overt he past two months, as well as a cough w/ productive clear phlegm in the morning, but all of these symptoms have been improving.

Patient notes that   evening had a large seafood dinner which is not usual for her, and then later around 10pm had acute onset of SOB feeling like she could not take deep breaths with chest tightness (patient notes this is her \"angina\"). Denies pleuritic component to CP, described as central and across lower rib cage, persistent since onset, no radiation to the shoulders/jaw/back, no diaphoreses. Worsens with activity, improves somewhat with rest. Patient does not it feels like other episodes when she then required her stent placement. Took a SLNx1, which improved her symptoms though these persisted, but almost immediately led to abdominal discomfort with vomiting x1, nonbloody with dinner pieces.  , 1 day prior to admission, decided to see if her pain improved on its own, then when it persisted on  , husband arranged for UC appt at    . At PCP,  , SBP up to 200s, EKG with ST depressions in the precordial leads, specifically V3, V4 and V5, given full dose ASA and SLNx1, and sent to the ED given concern for ACS versus HTN emergency. Patient reporting baseline sleeps with 2 pillows, unchanged recently, no cough, PND, orthopnea with 2 pillows. Worsening DOE since onset of symptoms, now unable to complete a block where she used to be able to walk a few blocks at a time without stopping   SOB/CP. Denies new   edema (baseline says L leg > R). Also had emesis last night x 1; no diaphoresis, no chest pain, no radiation of symptoms anywhere. No diarrhea or constipation, no dysuria, no focal weakness/numbness. On ROS, also with some L leg tingling intermittently, stable and chronic. Had diarrhea x1 on   following   seafood dinner, normal BMs since then. In the ED initial vital signs; T 98 P 88 BP 190/120 R 18 O2 Sat 98% 3L nasal cannula. Labs notable for Cr 2.1 (baseline 2.1-2.7), BUN 29. wbc 4.3, H/H 8.6/26.0, Plt 147. Initial and rpt Tn <0.01. BNP 4279. CXR showed no pulmonary edema, pleural effusions, or consolidation, borderline cardiomegaly. The patient received carvedilol, nebulizers, and IV lasix. It is unclear how much UOP the patient has as it was not documented in the ED. The patient was seen by cardiology in the ED who felt that in the setting of systolic heart failure, her dyspnea was likely due to a CHF exacerbation in the setting of dietary indiscretion. Diuresis was recommended in addition to increasing carvedilol to 12.5mg BID, as well as a nuclear stress test this morning. On the floor, the patient c/o of some improved dyspnea/chest tightness as well as wheezing (no COPD/asthma history, no significant smoking history), but otherwise has no acute complaints. Given her continued SOB and wheezing, she was written for nebulizers and steroids for reactive airway disease overnight.   \n",

During her recent hospitalization she was ruled out for an MI with three negative sets of cardiac enzymes, she had a stress echo which showed inducible ischemia at the achieved workload, thought to be single vessel disease per the echo report. At that time the plan was for medical management, given her severe underlying pulmonary disease she was not started on a beta blocker, but was started on diltiazem 120mg daily. Also during that admission she was found to have intermittent episodes of MAT. Today she was on the phone with her   year old aunt, who is very hard or hearing, she says that she became frustrated when her aunt was   to hear her on the phone and she started to have some chest pain. The pain began in the   her chest, as a dull pain then moved up to her left shoulder and under her left breast, at its worst was a  . She took three SL nitro's at home, with some minor improvement in her CP but when it did not resolve she called Dr.   referred her to the ER. She denied any associated SOB, nausea/vomiting. She denies any orthopnea, PND,   edema or palpitations. . In the ED, initial vitals were 98.7, 73, 183/92, 20, 98% on RA. Her EKG had a LBBB that was unchanged from prior, CXR with no acute process. Patient given aspirin 243mg since she had already taken 81mg of aspirin at home. She was not given anything for her episodes of chest pain as they resolved without further intervention.

The higher the score, the greater is the discriminating power of a given word or, in this case, a phrase of two words. For example, the feature \"cath\" with the score of 9,917 is strongly associated with the positive class, \"Chest Complaint\", i.e., it appears with a greater frequency in discharge notes with some type of chest complaint.
